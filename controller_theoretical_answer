I would like to answer first the question about how to check whether Virat has followed the path as planned.I worked on the micromouse techsoc event and in that we used rotary encoders in built with stepper motors to keep track of the distance moved(odometry) and we can do the same in Virat.We can use gyro to measure the angle rotated by the vehicle and use a gps tracker to get the real time position of the vehicle. We can create a closed loop feedback to check whether the Virat is moving along the right path or not.

For obstacle detection,we can use stereo cameras for depth modulation, which is computed from the disparity(difference in image location of the same 3D point under perspective to two different cameras) and then determining the depth using triangulation, on three sides of Virat,i.e,front, left and right side of the vehicle and this information can be used for SLAM(simulataneous localization and mapping) to construct the map of the unknown environment.There are better methods like using stereo as energy optimzation. We can also use sensors like LIDAR(light detection and ranging), as used in cameras for auto-focus,which sends a laser light and then measures the reflected light using a sensor, for surveying the environment. After having a rough idea of where the obstacle is, we use one of various path planning algorithms like grid based search to find the optimal path avoiding the obstacles given the initial and final destinations.I worked on the micromouse event for techsoc and there we used flood fill algorithm to reach the center of the maze.
