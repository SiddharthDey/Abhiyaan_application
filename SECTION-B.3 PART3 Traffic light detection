I tried training the custom object detection using ImageaAI and yolov3 by following an article on the net but I had some problems installing tensorflow on my laptop so I again tried something on google colab but that didn't work either.I annotated the sample data given in the application using LabelImg which i have put in the drive link below:-

and here is the python code i tried but didn't work

Code to run the model:-

from imageai.Detection.Custom import DetectionModelTrainer

trainer = DetectionModelTrainer()
trainer.setModelTypeAsYOLOv3()
trainer.setDataDirectory(data_directory="traffic_light")
trainer.setTrainConfig(object_names_array=["traffic_light"], batch_size=4, num_experiments=100, train_from_pretrained_model="pretrained-yolov3.h5")
trainer.trainModel() 

Code to use the trained model to identify trafficz-light:-

from imageai.Detection.Custom import CustomObjectDetection

detector = CustomObjectDetection()
detector.setModelTypeAsYOLOv3()
detector.setModelPath("traffic_light-ex-60--loss-2.76.h5") 
detector.setJsonPath("detection_config.json")
detector.loadModel()
detections = detector.detectObjectsFromImage(input_image="traffic_light1.jpg", output_image_path="traffic_light-detected.jpg")
for detection in detections:
    print(detection["name"], " : ", detection["percentage_probability"], " : ", detection["box_points"])
